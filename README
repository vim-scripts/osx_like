This color scheme is derived from the excellent sienna color scheme with some adjustments: There is only one color set for light background, and it looks best under gvim.
I adjusted almost only the colors for line numbers, folding and status bar. A screen shot can be found at http://img443.imageshack.us/my.php?image=osxlikejx7.gif
